				<p>Pigeon is one of only three bird species to produce a milk-like substance to feed their young. Interestingly enough, males also produce milk. Some species can find their way back home half-way around the world. How they do it is still a mystery. They are among the few birds that can suck water while their head is down, without having to lift their heads.</p>
